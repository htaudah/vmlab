# Playbook to configure a machine for certificate generation and use it to generate all the
# needed environment SSL certificates. certbot is used for the entire process, with DNS
# as the validation mechanism. This means that (i) Let's Encrypt is used as the CA and
# (ii) that DNS validation is used.
